        music, running (not as often as I'd like), scuba diving, and cooking. I
        studied at University of St Andrews in Scotland for my undergraduate
        degree and received a Masters degree at NYU right after college. I
        worked at Sony Music for a bit but now I'm looking to expand my digital
        marketing knowledge with the wonders of code.</p>
